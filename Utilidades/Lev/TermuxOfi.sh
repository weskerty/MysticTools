# ðŸ’¡ Prevent Force Close (Optional)
# In case Termux keeps closing on you, try this. It's better to do it Command by Command, but Copying and Pasting Everything Should Work Too.

# On some phones, the "Disable Child Process Restrictions" option appears in Developer Options
# You can do this process from your PC or from Termux itself by following this tutorial https://gist.github.com/kairusds/1d4e32d3cf0d6ca44dc126c1a383a48d
